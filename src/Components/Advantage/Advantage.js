                To join you must be 16 years old and above. We will only entertain members under 16 if they are obese, are under doctor advisement and take up personal training. All membership agreements for children under 16 years of age need to be authorised and signed by a legal guardian.

                At Fitness First, we believe that exercise is a lifelong habit. That is why when it comes to freezing of your membership, it will only be for medical reasons or outstation/overseas assignments for more than 2 weeks with written notice. For further information, please contact our Front Of House.
